Hi, Iâ€™m @AlbertoSaraZ

This is my personal github account! I'll use it to upload different projects. 

I hold a particular interest in machine learning and computer vision, but I enjoy programming in general. Currently I haven't set up a contact email so if you would like to contact me for any reason, send me a message on LinkedIn:

https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-s-z/

Please put a message in the connection invite ðŸ™‚

Enjoy your stay through my repos!
